# Appointment-booking-system
## project Overview

The Appointment Booking System is a full-stack web application developed to simplify the process of scheduling appointments between users and service providers. Instead of relying on manual booking methods, this system provides an online platform where users can easily view available slots, book appointments, manage their bookings, and cancel appointments whenever required.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in Full Stack Web Development. It demonstrates the implementation of both frontend and backend technologies while following a structured approach to web application development.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To simplify the appointment booking process.
- To provide a user-friendly and responsive interface.
- To reduce manual effort involved in scheduling appointments.
- To implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- To understand the integration of frontend, backend, and database technologies.

## Features

- User-friendly interface
- Book appointments online
- View scheduled appointments
- Cancel appointments
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Dynamic data management
- RESTful API integration
- Fast and smooth user experience

##  Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/likithasiripurapu/Appointment-booking-system.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the project folder

```bash
cd Appointment-booking-system
```

### Step 3: Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start the backend server

```bash
node server.js
```

### Step 5: Start the frontend

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start running on your local machine.


## Working of the System

1. The user opens the application.
2. Available appointment options are displayed.
3. The user enters the required details.
4. The booking request is sent to the backend.
5. The backend validates the request and stores the information in the MongoDB database.
6. The booked appointment is displayed to the user.
7. Users can also cancel or manage their appointments whenever required.


## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Building responsive web interfaces using React.
- Developing REST APIs using Express.js.
- Connecting applications with MongoDB.
- Handling CRUD operations.
- Managing project versions using Git and GitHub.
- Understanding frontend-backend integration.
- Debugging and testing web applications.

##  Testing

The application was tested to ensure proper functionality of all major features.

| Test Case | Status |
